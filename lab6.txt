Question 1
----------
Using git, I can add heroku as a remote repo and simply push to it.
Github integration is available. This is useful for automatic CI/CD with 
Github actions / workflows.
Apparently Docker and other options are also available.


Question 2
----------
A Procfile is used to declare an entry point. 
In my case, I'm using mysite/wsgi.py, served by gunicorn.
