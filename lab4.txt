Question 2
----------
The browser displays a django start page; "the install worked successfully!"


Question 3
----------
Root level is now a 404, and /polls/ displays the hello world message I wrote.


Question 4
----------
Django migration is about safely updating the schema of our database. 
The migrate command makes sure all of these changes are synchronized with any
data that's already in the database. 
Migrations need to be done whenever the models (ie. models.py) are changed, 
since the models reflect the internal schema (Object Relation Mapping).
This way, we can make changes to a database's schema in production and not 
have to displace any of its data. 


Question 5
----------
I see the Django administration dashboard. Here I can add and change 
instances of models.
New models can be added to the dashboard by registering them in admin.py.


Question 6
----------
"You're looking at question 38."
"You're looking at the results of question 38."
"You're voting on question 38."
Attempting to put in a non-integer results in a 404.
<int:question_id> would have to be altered to <slug:question_id>;
slug matches any string of ASCII letters or numbers, hyphens, and underscores.
In Django these are called "path converters".


Question 7
----------
Hardcoding URLs into templates makes them difficult to change or edit later
because you have to hunt down each one in the templates.
Passing them as arguments in the views keeps all the hardcoded URLs together 
where they can easily be changed.
