Question 4
----------
Django migration is about safely updating the schema of our database. 
The migrate command makes sure all of these changes are synchronized with any
data that's already in the database. 
Migrations need to be done whenever the models (ie. models.py) are changed, 
since the models reflect the internal schema (Object Relation Mapping).
This way, we can make changes to a database's schema in production and not 
have to displace any of its data. 


Question 5
----------
I see the Django administration dashboard. Here I can add and change 
instances of models.
New models can be added to the dashboard by registering them in admin.py.
